# //type coversion
    =>python auto convert type (implicit conversion)
    => example: a = 5
                b = 5.3
                print(a+b) //10.3 [(5.0 + 5.3) here float is superior value] 

# //type casting
    => manually conver data type
    => example: a,b = 5,"2"
                c = int(b)
                print(a+c) //7
